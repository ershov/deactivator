Super-lightweight page deactivator in one click.

Tired of a webpage, sucking your CPU in the background?
But there is something useful in it so you'd like to keep it open?
Deactivate the web page!
Cease all scripts activity on the current page, thus saving CPU, memory, and network.
Also, overall page responsiveness improves making if feel faster.

Works somewhat similar to 'Tab Suspender' but leaves the whole page accessible, just removing all active components and hidden scripts.

In contrast to NoScript-like extensions, works only on demand.

To activate, just click on the extension icon.
